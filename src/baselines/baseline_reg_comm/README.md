# Regular Communciation Baseline

To run the baseline, make sure you have all the dependencies installed. You can install them by following the instructions in the README.md file in the root directory of the repository.

To run the baseline (inference), you can use the following command:

```bash
python baseline_regular_comm.py or use the provided notebook: baseline_regular_comm.ipynb
```

This will run the agent on the model defined in the paper with regular communication. You can change the environment by changing the `model.py` file.

We have also provided the ground truth trajectory for the trained model in the `ground_truth` directory.
